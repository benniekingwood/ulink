                    <p>
                        <span>Founded in 1872 as a land-grant institution named Virginia Agricultural and Mechanical College, Virginia Tech is now a comprehensive, innovative research university with the largest number of degree offerings in Virginia, more than 125 campus buildings, a 2,600-acre main campus, off-campus educational facilities in six regions, a study-abroad site in Switzerland, and a 1,700-acre agriculture research farm near the main campus. The campus proper is located in the Town of Blacksburg in Montgomery County and is 38 miles southwest of Roanoke, in the New River Valley. Through a combination of its three missions of teaching and learning, research and discovery, and outreach and engagement, Virginia Tech continually strives to accomplish the charge of its motto: Ut Prosim (That I May Serve). </span></p>

                    <p>
                        <span>Virginia Tech offers about 65 bachelor&#39;s degree programs through its seven undergraduate academic colleges, 145 master&#39;s and doctoral degree programs through the graduate school, and a professional degree from the Virginia-Maryland Regional College of Veterinary Medicine. In addition, the Virginia Tech Carilion School of Medicine and Research Institute, a private, independent school jointly managed by the university and Carilion Health System, opened in fall 2010. </span></p>

                    <h2>Rankings</h2>
                    <p><span>In the U.S. News &amp; World Report&#39;s Best Colleges 2011¬ç, Virginia Tech ranked 69th among national universities and 30th among national public universities. In a more recent report, the Virginia Tech College of Engineering undergraduate program was ranked 13th in the nation (tied with Northwestern University and the University of Wisconsin-Madison) among all accredited engineering schools that offer doctorates and seventh among engineering schools at public universities. Six Virginia Tech undergraduate engineering specialties ranked among the top 20 of their respective peer programs (aerospace engineering, 10th; civil engineering, 7th; electrical engineering, 17th; engineering science and mechanics, 8th; environmental engineering, 9th; industrial engineering, 4th; and mechanical engineering, 14th, Biological System Engineering, 8th). Its graduate program in Engineering is considered among the first 20 in US, among all public and private universities, with strong emphasis on intensive interdisciplinary research. The Pamplin College of Business undergraduate program was ranked 42nd (2011) among the nation&#39;s undergraduate business programs and 10th among public institutions. Pamplin&#39;s overall ranking places it in the top 10 percent of the approximately 524 U.S. undergraduate programs accredited by the Association to Advance Collegiate Schools of Business International. Virginia Tech was also recognized as having one of the top 14 cooperative education and internship programs in the nation. Virginia Tech ranks in the top 20 public colleges and universities nationally among colleges that offer a first-class educational experience at a bargain price, according to Kiplinger&#39;s Personal Finance magazine.</span></p>

                    <h2>Campus</h2>
                    <p>
                        <span>
                            The Blacksburg campus is arranged rather uniquely in comparison to other universities. In the center of campus lies the Drillfield, which is a large oval field running Northeast to Southwest, encircled by a one way street known as Drillfield Drive. The Drillfield&#39;s name stems from its continuous use by the Virginia Tech Corps of Cadets to conduct military drills. Two underground rivers underneath the drillfield cause it to gradually sink, making the land unsuitable for building and protecting it as an open space on campus. On the northwestern side of the Drillfield lies the majority of the academic and administrative buildings, including Burruss and McBryde halls. On the southeastern side of the Drillfield lies the majority of the residential buildings, including the residence halls, dining halls, and War Memorial Gym. Newman Library is located on the eastern side of campus and connects to Torgersen Bridge, which spans the main road into campus, Alumni Mall. North of the Drillfield and northwest of Alumni Mall lies the Upper Quad, known to many students as military campus. The Upper Quad is home to the Corps of Cadets&#39; barracks and Shultz Dining center. On the Blacksburg campus, the majority of the buildings incorporate Hokie Stone as building material. In fact, it is now official university policy that all new buildings must incorporate the stone into their design. Hokie Stone is generally gray, shaded by hues of brown and pink. The limestone is mined from various quarries in Southwestern Virginia, Tennessee, and Alabama - one of which has been operated by the university since the 1950s. However, while it is true that the majority of buildings on campus incorporate Hokie Stone into their design, there are a few notable exceptions. For example, all buildings in the Upper Quad, which includes Lane and Shultz Halls, are constructed of red brick.

                    <h2>Athletics</h2>
                    <p></span>Virginia Tech&#39;s sports teams are called the Hokies, except for the swim team which uses a variant (&quot;H2Okies&quot;). Tech teams participate in the NCAA&#39;s Division I in the Atlantic Coast Conference, which the school joined in 2004 after leaving the Big East. Along with all other ACC schools, Tech&#39;s football team competes in Division I FBS, the higher of two levels of Division I competition in that sport. The Hokie Bird is a turkey-like creature whose form has evolved from the original school mascot of the Fighting Gobbler. While the modern Hokie Bird still resembles a Fighting Gobbler, the word &quot;Hokie&quot; has all but replaced Fighting Gobbler in terms of colloquial use. The term originated from the Old Hokie spirit yell, in which there was no particular meaning indicated for the word. The stylized VT (the abbreviation for Virginia Tech) is used primarily by the athletic department as a symbol for Virginia Tech athletic teams. The &quot;athletic VT&quot; symbol is trademarked by the university and appears frequently on licensed merchandise. During the early years of VPI, a rivalry developed between it and Virginia Military Institute. This rivalry developed into the original &quot;Military Classic of the South,&quot; an annual football game between VMI and VPI usually held on Thanksgiving Day in Roanoke, Virginia. That series ended after the 1984 season; VMI had elected to play at the Division I-AA level, now Division I FCS, after the NCAA&#39;s 1978 divisional split for football, and the schools&#39; wide disparity in size had led to a similar imbalance in results. Another long-standing and important rivalry is between Virginia Tech and the University of Virginia.</span></p>
